<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>
According to data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry's National Waste Management Information System (SIPSN), Indonesia will produce 21.1 million tons of waste by 2022. Of this amount, only 65.71% or around 13.9 million tons can be managed properly. The current condition in Indonesia is characterized by high waste productivity as well as a lack of public awareness and knowledge on how to recycle certain types of waste. Therefore, this project aims to reduce waste productivity in Indonesia as well as increase the level of community participation in waste recycling activities by creating an application that can be used as a reference media for crafts or processed waste based on the input of images provided.
